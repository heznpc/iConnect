:::caution[Deprecated on macOS 26+]
Apple removed the entire Podcasts JXA scripting dictionary in macOS 26 (Tahoe).
Because this is a permanent removal rather than a one-release regression, all
six Podcasts tools are **skipped at module registration** on macOS 26 and every
later release (see `compatibility.maxMacosVersion: 25` in
[`src/shared/modules.ts`](https://github.com/heznpc/AirMCP/blob/main/src/shared/modules.ts)).
They remain available on macOS ≤ 25 hosts.

- **Deprecated since:** v2.11.0
- **Removed at:** v3.0.0
- **Replacement:** investigating Shortcuts bridge or Media framework alternatives
- **Surfaced by:** `airmcp doctor` and `print-compat-report`
