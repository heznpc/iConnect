// RFC 0007 Phase A — shared entry point for every code-generated AppIntent.
//
// Generated/MCPIntents.swift calls `MCPIntentRouter.shared.call(...)`. The
// actual transport (execFile stdio on macOS, in-process on iOS) varies by
// host, and the host owns components AirMCPKit can't depend on upward:
//   macOS app → uses app/Sources/AirMCPApp/AppIntents.swift:runAirMCPTool
//               (Process + Pipe machinery against the npx-installed airmcp)
//   iOS app   → uses ios/Sources/AirMCPServer/MCPServer.swift in-process
//               (no IPC; just an actor.call with JSONRPCRequest).
//
// Rather than conditional compilation against those upper modules
// (which would introduce a circular dependency), the router accepts an
// async handler that the host installs at launch. AirMCPKit stays
// dependency-free; the host is responsible for wiring the transport.
//
// Phase A.2a (this file): handler injection + stable public API.
// Phase A.2b (follow-up): broaden generated intents from 10 → ~150 and
// switch ReturnsValue<String> to typed payload.
