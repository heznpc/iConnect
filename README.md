> Available in multiple languages at the [project landing page](https://heznpc.github.io/AirMCP/).

## Features

- **266 tools** (27 modules) — Apple app CRUD + system control + Apple Intelligence + UI Automation + Screen Capture + Maps + Podcasts + Weather + iWork (Pages/Numbers/Keynote) + Google Workspace + dynamic shortcuts
- **32 prompts** — per-app workflows (notes, calendar, reminders, shortcuts) + cross-module + developer workflows + YAML skills
- **8 MCP resources** — Notes, Calendar, Reminders, Music, Mail, System live data URIs
- **JXA + Swift 6.2 bridge** — JXA for basic automation, Swift 6 strict concurrency with EventKit/PhotoKit for advanced features
- **Recurring events/reminders** — EventKit recurrence rules (macOS 26+ Swift bridge)
- **Photo import/delete** — PhotoKit photo management (macOS 26+ Swift bridge)
- **Apple Intelligence** — On-device summarize, rewrite, proofread (macOS 26+)
- **Native menubar app** — SwiftUI companion with onboarding wizard, auto-start, log viewer, update notifications, permission setup, server crash auto-restart
- **42 Swift unit tests** — XCTest suites for AirMCPKit (types, formatting, recurrence) and AirMCPServer (JSON-RPC, MCP dispatch)
- **One-click setup** — `setup_permissions` tool or menubar app to request all macOS permissions at once
- **Dual transport** — stdio (default, safe local) + HTTP/SSE (`--http`) for remote agents and registries
- **CLI ergonomics** — `--version` flag, `NO_COLOR` support, unknown command rejection, config validation warnings
- **Safety annotations** — readOnly/destructive hints on all tools

## Get Started (2 minutes)

### 1. Install Node.js

If you don't have Node.js, install it first:

```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install node

# Or download from https://nodejs.org (LTS version)
```

### 2. Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
npx airmcp init
```

This will:
- Let you choose which Apple apps to connect (Notes, Calendar, Reminders, etc.)
- Automatically configure your MCP client
- Save your preferences to `~/.config/airmcp/config.json`

### 3. Restart Your MCP Client

That's it! Your AI can now read your notes, manage reminders, check your calendar, and more.

### Troubleshooting

```bash
npx airmcp doctor
```

Checks Node.js version, config files, MCP client setup, macOS permissions, and module status — all in one command.

## Try It — Talk to Your Mac

Once connected, just ask your AI in natural language. Here are some things you can try:

**Everyday**
- "Read my latest notes and summarize them"
- "What's on my calendar today?"
- "Show me overdue reminders and reschedule them to tomorrow"
- "Play some jazz on Apple Music"

**Productivity**
- "Draft a meeting agenda in Notes, then create calendar events for each topic"
- "Find all emails from Alex about the project and create reminders for action items"
- "Search my contacts for everyone at Acme Corp"

**System Control**
- "Turn on dark mode, set volume to 50%, and lower brightness"
- "Take a screenshot and save it to my Desktop"
- "What apps are running right now? Quit anything I'm not using"

**Research & Web**
- "Open the Apple developer docs in Safari and summarize the page"
- "Search my Safari tabs for that article I was reading about Swift"

**Power User**
- "Scan nearby Bluetooth devices"
- "Get my current GPS coordinates and show the weather here"
- "Record my screen for 10 seconds"
- "Run my 'Morning Routine' shortcut"

**Cross-App Workflows**
- "Check today's meetings, find related notes, and create a prep checklist in Reminders"
- "Search my files for the Q1 report, read it, and draft a summary email to the team"

These are just starting points — with 262 tools across 27 Apple apps, the combinations are endless.

    "airmcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "airmcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add airmcp -- npx -y airmcp
```

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "airmcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "airmcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

  "mcpServers": {
    "airmcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "airmcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Other MCP Clients

Any client that supports the MCP stdio transport can use AirMCP. Use `npx -y airmcp` as the server command.

### Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heznpc/AirMCP.git
cd AirMCP
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

### Developer Testing

```bash
npm run dev:test -- notes             # test one module (fast, in-process)
npm run dev:test:changed              # test only git-changed modules
npm run dev:test:watch -- notes       # watch mode: auto re-test on save
npm run dev:test -- --tool list_notes # test a single tool
```

See [Testing & Debugging Guide](docs/testing.md) for the full testing workflow.

### Menubar App (Optional)

A native SwiftUI companion app for server status monitoring and permission setup.

```bash
cd app && swift build -c release
# Binary: app/.build/release/AirMCPApp
```

Features: onboarding wizard, auto-start on login, log viewer, update notifications, server status, one-click permission setup, MCP client config clipboard copy.

### HTTP Mode

HTTP server mode for remote agents, registries, and multi-client setups:

```bash
npx airmcp --http --port 3847
```

- Endpoint: `POST/GET/DELETE /mcp`
- Transport: Streamable HTTP + SSE (MCP spec 2024-11-05)
- Session management via `Mcp-Session-Id` header
- Default port: 3847

Useful for running a Mac Mini as an "always-on AI hub."

## Module Presets

By default, new installations start with 5 core modules (Notes, Reminders, Calendar, Shortcuts, System) to keep things simple. You can enable more anytime:

```bash
# Re-run the setup wizard to change modules
npx airmcp init

# Or enable all modules at once
npx airmcp --full
```

Or edit `~/.config/airmcp/config.json` directly:

```json
{
  "disabledModules": ["messages", "intelligence"]
}
```

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npx airmcp init` | Interactive setup wizard |
| `npx airmcp doctor` | Diagnose installation issues |
| `npx airmcp` | Start MCP server (stdio, default) |
| `npx airmcp --version` | Print version and exit |
| `npx airmcp --full` | Start with all 27 modules enabled |

| `AIRMCP_INCLUDE_SHARED` | `false` | Include shared notes/folders |
| `AIRMCP_ALLOW_SEND_MESSAGES` | `false` | Allow sending iMessages (opt-in) |
| `AIRMCP_ALLOW_SEND_MAIL` | `false` | Allow sending emails (opt-in) |
| `AIRMCP_FULL` | `false` | Enable all modules (ignores preset) |
| `AIRMCP_DISABLE_{MODULE}` | — | Disable a specific module (e.g. `AIRMCP_DISABLE_MUSIC=true`) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | — | Google Gemini API key for cloud embeddings (optional) |
| `AIRMCP_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `gemini-embedding-2-preview` | Gemini embedding model name |

### Config File

`~/.config/airmcp/config.json`:

```json
{
  "disabledModules": ["messages", "intelligence"],
  "includeShared": false,
  "allowSendMessages": false,
  "allowSendMail": false,
  "hitl": {
    "level": "destructive-only",
    "timeout": 30
  }
}
```

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

Require manual approval before destructive operations:

```json
{
  "hitl": {
    "level": "destructive-only",
    "timeout": 30
  }
}
```

Levels: `off`, `destructive-only`, `all-writes`, `all`

### Semantic Search (Optional)

On-device cross-app semantic search powered by Apple's NLContextualEmbedding. Find related notes, events, reminders, and emails by meaning — not just keywords.

```bash
npm run swift-build  # Build the Swift bridge first
```

Then use the tools:
1. `semantic_index` — Index data from enabled Apple apps into a local vector store
2. `semantic_search` — Search by meaning across all indexed data
3. `find_related` — Find items related to a specific note/event/reminder
4. `semantic_status` — Check index status

Supports Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese with automatic language detection. Optionally set `GEMINI_API_KEY` for higher-quality Google Gemini embeddings.

### Swift Bridge (Optional)

For semantic search, recurring events/reminders (EventKit), photo import/delete (PhotoKit), and Apple Intelligence — requires macOS 26+:

```bash
npm run swift-build
```

## Requirements

- macOS
- Node.js >= 18
- Per-app automation permissions (prompted on first run) — use `setup_permissions` tool to request all at once
- Apple Intelligence: macOS 26+ with Apple Silicon

## Limitations

Modules with OS requirements (e.g., Intelligence requires macOS 26+) are automatically disabled at startup on older systems via runtime OS detection.

### Architecture & Security

- **JXA/AppleScript dependency** — Core automation relies on Apple's scripting dictionaries. While these have been stable for 10+ years, macOS updates can theoretically break individual modules. Circuit breaker (3 failures → 60s auto-disable) isolates failures. UI Automation tools (6 tools) are inherently more brittle and separated into their own module.
- **Input sanitization** — `run_javascript` blocks `javascript:` and `data:` URL schemes to prevent code injection. `escJxaShell` strips control characters from shell arguments.
- **Read data exposure** — Destructive operations require HITL approval, but read operations (mail, messages, contacts) are not rate-limited. When connected to cloud LLMs, sensitive data passes through the LLM provider. Mitigations: PII scrubbing in logs, pagination limits, sensitive modules (mail, messages) require explicit opt-in.
- **IPC overhead** — Multi-process path (Client → Node.js → osascript/Swift CLI → macOS app). Each JXA call adds ~50ms overhead. Pagination prevents bulk data transfers. Swift bridge path bypasses JXA for EventKit/PhotoKit operations.
- **Scope** — 262 tools across 27 modules follow 5 repeating patterns (JXA CRUD, Swift bridge, HTTP API, System Events, CLI wrapper), keeping maintenance proportional to pattern count, not tool count.

### Location & Bluetooth

- Location requires macOS Location Services permission (first use triggers system dialog).
- Bluetooth scanning discovers BLE (Low Energy) devices only. Classic Bluetooth devices are listed via `list_bluetooth_devices` in the System module.
- Bluetooth connect/disconnect operates within the server process lifecycle.

### Notes
- Move copies and deletes (new ID, reset dates, lost attachments). Update replaces entire body — read first to preserve content.
- Password-protected notes cannot be read.

### Reminders / Calendar
- JXA recurrence is read-only — use `create_recurring_event`/`create_recurring_reminder` (Swift/EventKit).
- Calendar attendees are read-only.

### Contacts
- Custom fields not accessible.

### Mail
- Content truncated to 5000 chars by default (`maxLength` parameter adjustable).

### Messages
- Individual message content (chat history) not accessible via JXA.
- Send requires recipient to be a registered buddy in Messages.

### Music
- Smart playlists are read-only.
- Queue manipulation not available.

### Finder
- Tags use Spotlight (mdfind), performance varies with index state.

### Safari
- Reading page content requires "Allow JavaScript from Apple Events" in Safari Developer menu.
- `run_javascript` rejects `javascript:` and `data:` URLs to prevent injection attacks.
- **macOS 26+:** Bookmark and Reading List tools (`list_bookmarks`, `list_reading_list`, `add_bookmark`) use `Bookmarks.plist` instead of JXA (Apple removed bookmark scripting). Requires **Full Disk Access** for your terminal in System Settings > Privacy & Security. `add_bookmark` is not supported on macOS 26+.

### Podcasts
- **macOS 26+:** All Podcasts tools are non-functional. Apple removed the Podcasts scripting dictionary in macOS 26 (Tahoe). The circuit breaker will auto-disable the module after 3 failures.

### Photos
- JXA: album creation and photo addition only, no import/delete.
- Swift bridge (macOS 26+): full import/delete via PhotoKit.

### Pages / Numbers / Keynote
- **macOS 26+:** Apple renamed iWork apps (e.g. "Pages" → "Pages Creator Studio"). AirMCP uses bundle IDs internally so this is handled transparently.
- Requires the corresponding iWork app to be open for document operations.

### Apple Intelligence
- Requires macOS 26 (Tahoe) + Apple Silicon.
- Build bridge binary with `npm run swift-build`.

## Roadmap

### v2.1 (Current)

- **Gemini Embedding 2** — Apple Intelligence의 Gemini 채택에 맞춰 `gemini-embedding-2-preview`로 업그레이드. 네이티브 멀티모달(텍스트/이미지/오디오/비디오) 3072차원 임베딩. on-device Swift bridge + cloud Gemini 하이브리드 provider 지원. Apple이 Foundation Models에 Gemini를 도입하면서 AirMCP도 동일 생태계로 확장
- **Google Workspace** — Gmail, Drive, Sheets, Calendar, Docs, Tasks, People via `@googleworkspace/cli`
- **Dynamic module loading** — New modules = 1 line in MANIFEST (no import boilerplate)
- **Centralized constants** — All API URLs, timeouts, buffer sizes in `src/shared/constants.ts` with env var overrides

### v2.0

- **CoreLocation** — Native GPS coordinates via Swift/CLLocationManager
- **CoreBluetooth** — BLE device scanning, state, connect/disconnect via Swift/CBCentralManager
- **App Management** — Launch, quit, check app status
- **Window Management** — List, move, resize, minimize windows across all apps
- **Geocoding** — Forward/reverse geocoding via Open-Meteo and Nominatim APIs
- **Security hardening** — Sensitive modules (mail, messages) opt-in by default, architecture limitations documented

### Platform Constraints (macOS 26+)

- **Safari bookmarks/reading list** — Apple removed JXA bookmark scripting classes in macOS 26. The plist fallback (`~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist`) requires Full Disk Access, which TCC blocks for MCP server processes. Investigating Shortcuts-based or WebExtension bridge approaches.
- **Safari `add_bookmark`** — Legacy JXA `make new bookmark` no longer supported in macOS 26. No programmatic alternative available yet.
- **Podcasts** — Apple removed the Podcasts JXA scripting dictionary entirely in macOS 26. All 6 Podcasts tools return errors. Investigating Shortcuts bridge or Media framework alternatives.

### Future

- **OAuth 2.1 + PKCE** — HTTP transport authentication for remote deployments
- **GUI .app distribution** — Code Signing + Notarization, Homebrew Cask
- **Marketplace listings** — mcp.so, Smithery, and other MCP directories
- **iOS / visionOS exploration** (v3.0+)
