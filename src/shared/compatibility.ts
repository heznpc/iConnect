/**
 * Module compatibility resolver (RFC 0004 — docs/rfc/0004-macos-compat-matrix.md).
 *
 * This module is **pure and side-effect-free**: given a module's declared
 * compatibility manifest plus the current runtime environment, it returns
 * a decision — should this module register its tools? register with a
 * deprecation warning? be skipped as unsupported? reported as broken?
 *
 * RFC 0004 Phase 1 scope: this file provides the types + resolver. The
 * existing runtime in `src/server/mcp-setup.ts` only uses `minMacosVersion`
 * today; migrating it to use `resolveModuleCompatibility()` is a follow-up
 * PR that doesn't change behaviour (same classification, just via the
 * typed resolver).
