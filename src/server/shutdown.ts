/**
 * Process-wide async shutdown orchestrator.
 *
 * Callers register async cleanup callbacks with `registerShutdownHook()`;
 * the server's SIGINT/SIGTERM wiring (in `init.ts`) invokes `runShutdownHooks()`
 * before calling `process.exit()`. Hooks run via `allSettled` so one hook's
 * rejection does not skip the others, and the whole sequence is bounded by
 * `GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` so a hanging hook cannot prevent exit.
 *
 * This lives in its own file so transport modules (http-transport.ts) can
 * register cleanup without importing `init.ts` — which would otherwise pull
 * in the full configuration / HITL / Swift bridge dependency graph and
 * complicate test mocking.
